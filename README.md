### Credits
The major credit goes to the Udacity team of instructors! They are amazing! The course materials by under the instructions of Juno Lee raised my Python skills and confidence level from Newbie to intermediate real quick.

I made use of various Stack Overflow Questions and Answers to get certain concepts working.

I also made use the Python3 Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/, NumPy Documentation: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/index.html, as well as Pandas Documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ to finish the project.
